## 💻 Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **RAM:** 8 GB (16 GB strongly recommended)
- **Storage:** 10 GB free disk space
- **Processor:** Dual-core CPU (2 GHz or higher)
- **Internet:** Stable broadband connection (required throughout training)

### Display Recommendations

**Strongly Recommended:**
- **Dual monitors** (or one large monitor 27"+ / 4K)
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 minimum per screen

**Why?** You'll need to:
- Keep training instructions visible on one screen
- Work in VS Code on another screen
- View documentation, terminal outputs, and browser simultaneously

**Not Recommended:**
- Single small laptop screens (13" or smaller)
- Working solely on a tablet (this is impossible!!!)
- Limited screen real estate makes it difficult to follow along efficiently

**Alternative if you only have one screen:**
- Use virtual desktops/workspaces to quickly switch between windows but not recommended! 
- Consider connecting an external monitor to your laptop

## 🔑 GitHub Copilot License & Setup

### Step 1: Verify Your GitHub Copilot Subscription

You need an **active GitHub Copilot Pro or Pro+ subscription** for this training.

**⚠️ Important:** The free trial will NOT work for this training because you need:
- **Agent mode** (multi-step autonomous tasks)
- **Advanced models** (GPT-5, Claude 4 Sonnet, Claude 4.5 Sonnet)
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** support

**Required subscription levels:**
- ✅ **GitHub Copilot Pro+** (best - includes all features)
- ✅ **GitHub Copilot Pro** (minimum - sufficient for training)
- ❌ **Free Trial** (insufficient - lacks agent mode and advanced models)
- ✅ **Business/Enterprise** (contact your admin to verify you have agent access)

**Check your access:**
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/copilot
2. Verify you see "GitHub Copilot is enabled"
3. Confirm your subscription shows **"Pro"** or **"Pro+"** (not "Free Trial")

e.g  GitHub Copilot Pro+ is active for your account

**Don't have access?**
- **Individual:** Upgrade to Pro at https://github.com/settings/copilot
- **Business/Enterprise:** Contact your organization's GitHub admin and request agent mode access
- **Students/Teachers:** Check if GitHub Education includes Pro https://education.github.com/

### Step 2: Verify Copilot Models

Ensure you have access to the following models:

| Model | Purpose | Access Level |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | Alternative for comparisons | Pro/Pro+ |
| **Claude Sonnet 4** | Advanced model | Pro+ |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | Latest advanced model | Pro+ |
| **GPT-5** | Advanced reasoning | Pro+ |
| **GPT-5-Codex** | Specialized for code generation | Pro+ |

**To check available models:**
1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code
  - macOS shortcut: press Cmd+Shift+P, type "Copilot: Open Chat" and press Enter or Cmd+Shift+I
  - Windows shortcut: press Ctrl+Shift+P, type "Copilot: Open Chat" and press Enter
2. Click the model selector dropdown (top-right of chat panel)
3. Verify you can see the advanced models (Claude Sonnet 4/4.5, GPT-5, GPT-5-Codex)

**If advanced models are missing:**
- You likely have **Pro** instead of **Pro+** - this will work but with limited access to newest models, this is not a problem for the training! 
- Business/Enterprise users: Your organization may have restricted models - contact your admin to request Pro+ access
- Individual users with Pro+: All models should be available by default

**Enable models on GitHub:** If you don't see the advanced models in VS Code, go to your GitHub Copilot settings and explicitly enable model access:

1. Visit: https://github.com/settings/copilot/features
2. Enable the advanced models or agent features (toggle on GPT-5 / Sonnet models)
3. Restart VS Code and re-open Copilot Chat

If you still don't see models after enabling, sign out and sign back into Copilot in VS Code, or contact your GitHub admin.

## 🛠️ Software Prerequisites by Operating System

### All Operating Systems

#### 1. **Git** (Version 2.30+)

**Check if installed:**
```bash
git --version
```

**Install:**
- **macOS:** Included with Xcode Command Line Tools (see below)
- **Linux:** `sudo apt-get install git` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum install git` (CentOS/RHEL)
- **Windows:** https://git-scm.com/download/win

**Configure Git (required):**
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

#### 2. **VS Code** (Latest Stable Version)

**Download:** https://code.visualstudio.com/download

**Required VS Code Extensions:**

Install these extensions by clicking the links or searching in VS Code Extensions panel (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`):

1. **GitHub Copilot** (`GitHub.copilot`)
   - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot

  You do not need to switch to pre-release version though if some features will not be available during the training that might be a solution. However, for now install the latest version.  
   
2. **GitHub Copilot Chat** (`GitHub.copilot-chat`)
   - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat

3. **Python** (`ms-python.python`)
   - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

**Recommended Extensions:**
4. **Jupyter** (`ms-toolsai.jupyter`) - for notebook exercises
5. **Docker** (`ms-azuretools.vscode-docker`) - if doing Docker homework, it will not be needed for the training itself, so it is not a must! 

**Verify extensions are installed:**
1. Open VS Code
2. Open the Extensions view:
  - macOS: press `Cmd+Shift+X`
  - Windows/Linux: press `Ctrl+Shift+X`
3. In the search box, verify each of the following shows "Installed":
  - "GitHub Copilot"
  - "GitHub Copilot Chat"
  - "Python" (by Microsoft)
4. If any are missing, click "Install" and then "Reload" if prompted
5. If prompted, "Sign in to GitHub" to activate Copilot 
6. Before the training make sure that you are signed in and you can clone the repositories, otherwise it will take too much time during training!

### macOS Setup

#### 1. **Xcode Command Line Tools**

Required for compiling Python packages and Git.

**Install:**
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Click "Install" when prompted. This takes 5-10 minutes.

**Verify:**
```bash
xcode-select -p
# Should output: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

#### 2. **Homebrew** (Package Manager)

**Install Homebrew:**
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the post-install instructions to add Homebrew to your PATH.

**Verify:**
```bash
brew --version
```
If brew is not found, make sure you are in zsh and not bash terminal in VS Code



#### 3. **Python 3.11** (Python 3.9-3.11 recommended)

**Install via Homebrew:**
```bash
brew install python@3.11
```

**Verify:**
```bash
python3 --version
# Should show Python 3.8 or higher
```

**Add to PATH (if needed):**
```bash
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### 4. **Synth CLI** (Data Generation Tool)

**IMPORTANT:** This tool is required for the exercises. Make sure it runs successfully on your machine before training.

**Install:**
```bash
# Create directory for synth
mkdir -p ~/.synth/bin

# Download Synth v0.6.9 from shuttle-hq repository
curl -L https://github.com/shuttle-hq/synth/releases/download/v0.6.9/synth-macos-latest-x86_64.tar.gz -o /tmp/synth.tar.gz

# Extract to synth directory
tar -xzf /tmp/synth.tar.gz -C ~/.synth/bin/

# Make executable
chmod +x ~/.synth/bin/synth

# Add to PATH
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.synth/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Verify (must succeed):**
```bash
synth version
```

Expected output: `synth 0.6.9`

- ✅ Install for all users (if you have admin rights)

**Verify (in Command Prompt or PowerShell):**
```cmd
python --version
pip --version
```

**Troubleshooting:** If "python" is not recognized:
1. Search for "Environment Variables" in Windows
2. Edit PATH variable
3. Add: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\` (adjust version)
4. Add: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts\`
5. Restart terminal

#### 3. **Git for Windows**

** WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**

1. **Enable WSL 2:**
```powershell
wsl --install
```

2. **Install Ubuntu from Microsoft Store**

3. **Inside WSL Ubuntu:**

**Then follow the MacOS instructions above for remaining setup.**

### Additional Tools (All Platforms)

#### **jq** (JSON Processor - for testing)

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install jq
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y jq
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Via chocolatey (if installed)
choco install jq

# Or download from: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/
```

**Verify:**
```bash
echo '{"test": "value"}' | jq .
```
